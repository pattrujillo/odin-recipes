        <h2>Perfect for pasta lovers!</h2>
        <p>
            This broccoli Alfredo past is so pretty made with
            bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine
            if you prefer. Add salad or some garlic bread, or both.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.   
                cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally,
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
                Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta for a later use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water.
                Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; season with salt.
                Keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat.
                Stir in cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cheese and garlic, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted.
                Stir in nutmeg and remove from heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. 
                Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
            </li>
