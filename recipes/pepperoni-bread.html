        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lbs loaf frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>4 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place thawed dough into a bowl; cover and let rise 
                in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet 
                with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll dough into a rectangle, then brush with beaten egg and
                arrange pepperoni over top. Sprinkle mozzarella, Parmesan, and 
                Italian seasoning over pepperoni. Roll dough over fillings
                like a jelly roll and pinch the seam to seal. Place dough, seam-side
                down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40min.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a bread knife to cut loaf into slices of your desired size.
            </li>
